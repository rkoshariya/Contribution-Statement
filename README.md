"# Contribution-Statement"

Given a research paper in PDF , how would you find the “contributing statements” of the paper? For definitions of contributing statement
and the task please refer to here: https://ncg-task.github.io

1. Write an algorithm to do so (PSEUDOCODE would do)
2. Write a neat code to extract the contributing statements from a paper based on the above
algorithm. You can use the trial data here: https://ncg-task.github.io/data.html
3. Generate an abstractive summary from the extracted contributing statements of the
paper (taking the abstract of the paper as the reference summary)
4. Evaluate your summary against the abstract of the paper using ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2,
ROUGE-L, BERTScore
5. Store the output from 2,3,4 in a CSV file.
