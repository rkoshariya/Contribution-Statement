0,"We propose structural scaffolds , a multitask model to incorporate structural information of scientific papers into citations for effective classification of citation intents .Our model achieves a new state - of the - art on an existing ACL anthology dataset ( ACL - ARC ) with a 13.3 % absolute increase in F1 score , without relying on external linguistic resources or hand - engineered features as done in existing methods .In addition , we introduce a new dataset of citation intents ( Sci - Cite ) which is more than five times larger and covers multiple scientific domains compared with existing datasets .Our code and data are available at : https://github.com/ allenai/scicite .","Structural Scaffolds for Citation Intent Classification in Scientific PublicationsOur code and data are available at : https://github.com/ allenai/scicite .In this work , we approach the problem of citation intent classification by modeling the language expressed in the citation context .To this end , we propose a neural multitask learning framework to incorporate knowledge into citations from the structure of scientific papers .In particular , we propose two auxiliary tasks as structural scaffolds to improve citation intent prediction : 1 ( 1 ) predicting the section title in which the citation occurs and ( 2 ) predicting whether a sentence needs a citation .On two datasets , we show that the proposed neural scaffold model outperforms existing methods by large margins .Our contributions are : ( i ) we propose a neural scaffold framework for citation intent classification to incorporate into citations knowledge from structure of scientific papers ; ( ii ) we achieve a new state - of - the - art of 67.9 % F1 on the ACL - ARC citations benchmark , an absolute 13.3 % increase over the previous state - of - the - art ; and ( iii ) we introduce SciCite , a new dataset of citation intents which is at least five times as large as existing datasets and covers a variety of scientific domains .","[{'rouge-1': {'r': 0.7093023255813954, 'p': 0.4959349593495935, 'f': 0.5837320525729722}, 'rouge-2': {'r': 0.3333333333333333, 'p': 0.19072164948453607, 'f': 0.24262294618994903}, 'rouge-l': {'r': 0.6744186046511628, 'p': 0.4715447154471545, 'f': 0.5550239186016804}}]"
